# Getting started with PDFix SDK
The build contain the libraries with headers and the command line
application(pdfix_app).

## Integration through the CLI
PDFix provides simple, fast and automated PDF processing through the
command-line. PDFix CLI is the easiest way to integrate the PDFix SDK
functionality into your solutions.

Technically the CLI is a an application created with our SDK.  Itâ€™s suitable
for system integrators without developer experience who want to integrate PDFix
technology.

## Integration through the SDK
PDFix SDK allows full control of integration and processing. It gives you
access to all SDK features and you have power to fully customise our extraction
and conversion engine.

Have a look at our functional examples to see how easy it is to integrate PDFix
SDK into your project. Speed up development by using our code examples!
